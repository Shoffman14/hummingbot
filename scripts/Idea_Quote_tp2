Script only trades at certain price levels, eg: only in VA area of a TPO. 
Tight TPs, like 20% on both sides 
Could be helpful to "anchor" one side at a key_price_level, like session/1d POC 
  -> Meaning, the bot would maintain that key_price_level so that it's = to my positiono's avg_entry_price 
  -> Another approach, anchor your take_profit orders to a key_price_level
